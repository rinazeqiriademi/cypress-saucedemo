# Cypress Automated Tests for SauceDemo App of Sauce Labs

This project contains tests written using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) designed to test the functionality of the [Sample Web App](https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-web) ([SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/)) running in a Docker container.

## Project Overview

This project automates the testing of the Sample Web App. The Sample Web App must be running before executing the tests. I have forked the Sample Web App and created a branch on my copy at https://github.com/rinazeqiriademi/saucedemo/tree/adjust-dockerfile-for-automated-tests, where I have adjusted the Dockerfile in order to run the application locally and then the tests against it. Cypress is used for testing interactions with the web appâ€™s user interface and checking the core functionalities.

## Prerequisites

To run these tests, you will need the following:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed (if you will run the Sample Web App in a Docker container).
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
- The [Sample Web App](https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-web) running.

## Setting Up the Sample Web App

Before running Cypress tests, you need to have the Sample Web App running locally in a Docker container.

### Start the Docker Container

1. Clone my forked copy of Sample Web App from https://github.com/rinazeqiriademi/saucedemo/tree/adjust-dockerfile-for-automated-tests
2. Navigate to the cloned directory 
    ```bash
    cd saucedemo
   ```
3. Checkout branch 
   ```bash 
   git checkout adjust-dockerfile-for-automated-tests
   ```
   
4. Build the Docker Image by running the following command in the root directory of the project, where the Dockerfile is located:
   ```bash
   docker build -t saucedemo .
   ```
5. Run the Docker Container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 saucedemo
   ```
   The application will start inside the Docker container and can be accessed at http://localhost:3000.

## Setting Up the Cypress Tests

### Install dependencies
In the root directory where you have cloned this repository, run:

```bash
   npm install
 ```
### Run Cypress tests: 
You can run Cypress tests in either interactive or headless mode:

- To run Cypress in the interactive mode:

```bash
   npx cypress open
```
- To run Cypress tests in headless mode:
```bash
   npx cypress run
 ```

### Project Structure
- **cypress/e2e/**: This is where the test files are located.
- **cypress/fixtures/**: Contains test data files used by the tests.
- **cypress/support/**: Contains utility functions or commands that support the tests.
